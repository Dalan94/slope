SLOPE
=====

Slope is a free (LGPL) C library for creating charts using the cairo 2D drawing
library. As long as Gtk+ uses cairo to render it's widgets, embedding slope's
charts in gtk is straitforward.

Slope is in it's early stages of development, but it is already able to produce
beautifull charts like the ones bellow. The code to draw these charts is in the
demos directory in the source tree.
