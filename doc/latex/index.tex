Slope is developed with the goal of providing an easy way to cairo and Gtk users to generate charts to visualize numerical data. The coding conventions are similar to those used in cairo.

Slope's only mandatory dependency is cairo, if you turn off the build flag that includes Gtk. The Gtk dependent build has the advantage of using the pango text layout library that is much more powerful than the cairo \char`\"{}toy\char`\"{} A\+P\+I for text rendering, and of course the ability to add a custom widget to your Gtk G\+U\+I with mouse zooming enabled.
