Slope is a free (L\+G\+P\+L) {\bfseries C} library that creates charts from numerical data. It's design principle is the following\+: {\bfseries T\+H\+E O\+N\+L\+Y D\+E\+P\+E\+N\+D\+E\+N\+C\+Y I\+S C\+A\+I\+R\+O}, and the {\bfseries A\+P\+I} is familiar to the users of cairo. Additionaly an alternative build provides a Gtk widget and some utilities so create simple chart windows and animations, such as real time data display. This build of course makes slope {\bfseries Gtk} dependent. The cairo only build will always be maintained.

Slope is in it's early stages of development and still needs some optimization and polishing. Some accessor methods to objects properties are also absent. But here's what we already have\+: The following chart is the output of the test.\+c program in de top level source repository.



Slope's basic usage is\+: create a {\bfseries slope\+\_\+figure\+\_\+t}, add one or more {\bfseries slope\+\_\+metrics\+\_\+t} to it and add some {\bfseries slope\+\_\+item\+\_\+t} to the metrics, then use function {\bfseries \hyperlink{group__Figure_ga386e261642ba2b0fdc39a550e3e94462}{slope\+\_\+figure\+\_\+draw()}} to stroke the resulting chart via a {\bfseries cairo\+\_\+t}.
